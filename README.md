# Mieber-Walk-Me-Here
This is a C program aim at implementing a request matching and pathfinding subroutines for a tool that helps people to find walking partners, which is derived from machine problem of ECE220 @UIUC. The following features were implemented in the program,
• Match requests: This program makes use of pyramid tree to quickly find the pairs who have nearby starting and ending points.  
• Find shortest path: This program uses Dijkstra's single-source shortest paths algorithm to find the shortest path. Additionally, heap is implemented to improve the performance.
